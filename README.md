# Raman Amplifiers
> Design and analysis of Raman optical amplifiers

Code for simulation, design, and analysis of Raman amplifiers. Code was written at Federal University of Espirito Santo, 2011-2012. Code was written in Portuguese. 

Functions for numerical model (i.e., numerical solution to boundary value problem) and analytical model were implemented in C++ in order to minimize runtime. Before using these functions, they must be compiled with the mex function from Matlab.
